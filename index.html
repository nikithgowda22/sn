            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> Bing is a web search engine developed by Microsoft. Google+, Instagram, and Twitter are all examples of social networking platforms."

            a: ["d"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> The core concept of 'social' networking is the interaction and building of social relations among people."

            a: ["d"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> This is the most comprehensive definition. A meme is a piece of culture or idea that spreads from person to person, and on the internet, this takes the form of digital artifacts like images, videos, or text."

            a: ["d"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores the graph layer by layer. A Queue (First-In, First-Out) is used to store the nodes to be visited, ensuring that nodes at the same 'depth' are processed before moving to the next level. A Stack is used for Depth-First Search (DFS)."

            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> A simple graph has no self-loops, so the diagonal of the adjacency matrix is all zeros. In an undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric. The maximum number of edges is `(n*(n-1))/2`. Since each edge (i, j) creates *two* non-zero entries in the matrix (at `A[i][j]` and `A[j][i]`), the maximum number of non-zero values is `2 * (n*(n-1))/2 = n*(n-1)`. (Note: The provided 'Accepted Answer' in the file was incorrect)."

                a: "Depends on the number of edges",

            },
            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> When using an adjacency matrix, checking for an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j` is a simple lookup of the value at `Matrix[i][j]`. This is an $O(1)$ operation, meaning its time is constant and does not depend on the number of vertices (n) or edges (e)."

            a: ["b"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: b.</strong> A 'Bipartite' graph is one whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V. A 'Complete Bipartite' graph is a special case where *every* vertex in U is connected to *every* vertex in V."
        },
        {
            q: "8. In a complete graph with n nodes, how many different triangles are present?",

            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> A triangle is formed by any three vertices in a complete graph (since all vertices are connected to all others). The problem is equivalent to asking 'How many ways can we choose 3 vertices from n vertices?'. This is a combination, or `nC3`.<br>`nC3 = n! / (3! * (n-3)!) = (n * (n-1) * (n-2)) / 6`.<br>Expanding the expression in option c: `(n^3-3n^2+2n)/6 = n(n^2-3n+2)/6 = n(n-1)(n-2)/6`. They are identical."

            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> This is the Handshaking Lemma. Every edge connects two vertices, so each edge contributes +1 to the degree of two different vertices. Therefore, when you sum the degrees of all vertices, you are counting every edge exactly twice. Sum of degrees = 2 * e."
        },

            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> A regular graph of degree `d` has `n` vertices, and each vertex has a degree of `d`. The sum of all degrees is `n * d`. From the Handshaking Lemma, we know the sum of degrees is also `2 * e`. Therefore: `n * d = 2 * e`, which rearranges to `e = (n * d) / 2`."

            a: ["c"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: c.</strong> The case study states, 'the initial viral spread came from peripheral nodes who had many weak ties to different communities'[cite: 544]. This aligns with Granovetter's 'Strength of Weak Ties' theory, where weak ties act as bridges for novel information."

            a: ["b", "d"], type: "msq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: b, d.</strong> To analyze spread, the model must be based on real interactions. [cite_start]The text says 'edges represent communication' [cite: 543] [cite_start]and the analysis involved 'weak ties' [cite: 544][cite_start], implying the network 'captures tie strength and type'[cite: 556]."
        },

            q: "Case 1, Q3. Why did the officials' initial assumption (news spreads from hubs) fail?",

            a: ["b"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: b.</strong> Hubs (like the officials) tend to have strong ties with each other, leading to redundant information. Peripheral nodes, with their weak ties, are the ones who bridge to other communities and introduce novel information (like the fire news) to new groups."
        },

            a: ["a", "b", "d"], type: "msq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: a, b, d.</strong> The case showed 'degree centrality only' (c) was a bad assumption. Closeness (a) identifies nodes that can reach everyone quickly. Eigenvector (b) identifies nodes connected to other important nodes. [cite_start]Betweenness (d) identifies nodes that bridge different communities, which is key to viral spread[cite: 544]."
        },

            q: "Case 1, Q5. If the network is very sparse but has a few long bridges, what does this imply?",

            a: ["d"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: d.</strong> 'Long bridges' are the pathways that connect otherwise distant clusters. [cite_start]Their presence creates the exact 'opportunity for rapid cross-cluster spread'[cite: 575]."
        },
        {
            q: "Case 1, Q6. How could the government improve its warning system using network insight?",
            options: { a: "Send alerts only to cluster heads", b: "Use peripheral weak-tie nodes to seed warnings", c: "Improve communication with high-betweenness nodes", d: "Track frequency of communication instead of just structure" },
            a: ["b", "c", "d"], type: "msq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: b, c, d.</strong> The case showed peripheral nodes with weak ties were effective spreaders (b)[cite: 579]. [cite_start]High-betweenness nodes (c) are, by definition, bridges[cite: 580]. [cite_start]Tracking frequency (d) helps identify tie strength, which is crucial[cite: 581]."

            a: ["a"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: a.</strong> PageRank works like a voting system. A link to your page is a 'vote'. A vote from a highly-ranked page (like a popular university course) counts far more than a vote from an unknown page. [cite_start]Thus, 'link-spamming' from high-rank courses can inflate a low-quality course's rank[cite: 590]."

            a: ["b", "c", "d"], type: "msq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: b, c, d.</strong> Personalization vectors (b) can bias the 'random surfer' toward a user's interests[cite: 597]. [cite_start]Including external quality metrics (c) like ratings creates a topic-sensitive or quality-weighted PageRank[cite: 598]. [cite_start]The damping factor (d) is a standard part of PageRank that prevents rank from getting 'stuck' in loops and ensures convergence[cite: 599]."
        },
        {
            q: "Case 2, Q3. If a course has no outbound links, how is it treated in classic PageRank?",

            a: ["b"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: b.</strong> This is a 'dangling node'. If untreated, it would be a 'rank sink' (c) and absorb all rank that flows to it. To solve this, PageRank teleports the rank from dangling nodes and distributes it uniformly among *all* nodes in the graph, thus conserving the total rank."

            a: ["a", "b", "d"], type: "msq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: a, b, d.</strong> (a) shows PageRank (popularity) is overriding quality[cite: 608]. (b) [cite_start]shows a bias against new content, as it hasn't had time to accumulate links[cite: 609]. (d) [cite_start]is a clear sign of a problem, as an unlinked course should have only the minimal 'random surfer' rank[cite: 611]."

            a: ["a"], type: "mcq",
            solution: "<strong>Correct Answer: a.</strong> The damping factor (d) models the 'random surfer' concept. It's the probability that the user will stop following links (1-d) and will instead 'teleport' to a random page on the graph (d)."

(Note: The PDF answer C=2.5 seems incorrect based on the text description. Let's re-read the PDF explanation: '(D is followed by B and C, each sending half of their 2 points 1+1 = 2)'. The PDF calculation gives 2, but the answer says 2.5. Let's assume the calculation in the PDF's explanation text is correct and the final answer letter is wrong). Recalculating assuming the PDF explanation is correct: B sends 1, C sends 1. D gets 1+1=2. Let's assume there's a typo in the PDF and stick to the calculation. If the PDF meant 5 points total initially (1 per user), B sends 1/2, C sends 1/2, D gets 1. If 10 points total were split 2 each, B sends 1, C sends 1, D gets 2. The PDF answer C=2.5 is likely wrong, based on the description. Rechecking the PDF explanation: 'each sending half of their 2 points 1+1=2'. Okay, the arithmetic in the explanation sums to 2, but the answer chosen is 2.5. This is contradictory. Let's assume the question meant A follows 2, B follows 2, C follows 2, D follows 1, E follows 1. Initial=2 points each. D gets points from B (2/2=1) and C (2/2=1). Total=2. Answer C=2.5 is likely incorrect based on the problem statement and provided reasoning. However, since the user wants the PDF answers, I'll provide C=2.5 and note the discrepancy. Corrected explanation based on PDF answer: D is followed by B and C. B follows 2, sends 2/2=1 point. C follows 2, sends 2/2=1 point. Total should be 2. The PDF answer C=2.5 implies a different point distribution or calculation rule not stated. Let's assume the intended calculation yielded 2.5 somehow." // Sticking with PDF answer C, despite calculation discrepancy.
